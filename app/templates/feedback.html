Using a hybrid approach that combined time-series analysis with feature engineering on similar product categories, I trained a machine learning model that improved forecast accuracy by 15%. This innovation enabled the supply chain team to optimize inventory levels, reducing overstock costs by 10% and minimizing stockouts during key launch periods. Additionally, I automated the modelâ€™s deployment pipeline, cutting manual intervention by 12 hours per week and streamlining the forecasting process across teams.\n\n <div></div> <b> Strengths:</b> \n <li>Highlighted your technical ability to integrate and use advanced tools like forecasting models.\n</li> <li>Demonstrated the positive impact on productivity through quantifiable metrics.</li>\n <b>Weaknesses:</b> <li>Could provide more context on the challenges faced during model development and subsequent actions taken.</li> <li>Lacked detail on specific results achieved through collaboration or communication.</li>\n <b>Suggestions:</b> <li>Use the STAR framework to expand on the situation and task that set the stage for the action.</li><li>Discuss specific metrics that showcase the effectiveness of the model relative to company targets.</li>"

The challenge was to account for real-time factors like traffic, weather, and package volume. I contributed by developing a machine learning model that dynamically adjusted delivery routes based on these variables. To ensure successful implementation, I worked closely with engineers to integrate the model into our logistics platform and collaborated with operations to validate the results in pilot tests. Our solution improved delivery efficiency by 18%, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction during critical periods.\n\n <div></div> <b> Strengths:</b> \n <li>Showed initiative in seeking knowledge to fill gaps in experience (learning PySpark).\n</li> <li>Good detail on processes followed to ensure project success.</li>\n <b>Weaknesses:</b> <li>More insight into the team's dynamics and your specific role could strengthen the answer.</li>\n <li> Lacked focus on soft skills such as communication and conflict resolution during collaboration.</li> <b>Suggestions:</b> <li>Articulate more clearly your role within the team and how you encouraged team cooperation.</li><li>Reflect on lessons learned about teamwork and how that shaped your future work engagements.</li>"
