We held daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and prioritize tasks. I took on the role of the Scrum Master, facilitating the meetings and making sure that everyone had a clear understanding of their responsibilities.\\nOne particular challenge we faced was the need to integrate a third-party data visualization library with our custom backend solution. I took the initiative to organize a brainstorming session with the frontend and backend developers, UX designers, and data scientists.\\nTogether we explored different integration approaches and identified potential roadblocks.\\n(Impact)\\xa0\\nWe were successful in delivering the real-time data analytics platform within the given timeline. What’s more, the client was delighted with the platform’s user-friendly interface, real-time insights, and advanced visualizations.\\n(Lessons)\\nThis experience taught me how important communication skills are in my role.

We hadn’t worked with them before, and it was a big name, so this was a huge opportunity for the company.\\n(Problem)\\nOne day before a key meeting with the potential client, the associate taking the lead on the deal got sick. As her symptoms developed, it became clear that she would not be able to attend the meeting and pitch our services to the new client. We had to decide whether to try to reschedule the meeting, or to go ahead without her leadership.\\n(Solution)\\nI knew that rescheduling the meeting at the last minute would make us appear unreliable to the potential client, so I called the other analysts and persuaded them that we should maintain the meeting and that I could give the pitch. They agreed, and we rehearsed the pitch together that evening.\\nThe next day, I gave the pitch and was able to answer the potential client’s questions, with help from the other analysts. I was able to remember most of what we prepared with the associate, and my teammates were able to support me in the other areas.\\n(Impact)\\nThe client asked for extra time to consider the deal, but did ultimately come back to us and accept. They are now one of our regular clients, and through that relationship alone we’ve brought in a little over $200,000 in revenue for the company.\\n(Lessons)\\nSo I learned how important it is to prepare in advance for all eventualities. Had we set up a contingency plan prior to the pitch, the associate’s illness would not have created such last-minute stress leading up to the meeting. So now I work to stay aware of needs outside of my job description, and to anticipate risks ahead of time.”',\n",

So I decided to take the initiative and start a basketball league on campus.\\xa0\\n(Problem)\\nMy goal was to get at least 6 teams and have regular, competitive games each week, plus social events so people could make new friends and feel part of a community.\\n(Solution)\\xa0\\nAt first I did everything myself - spread the word around campus to get sign ups, got payments and booked the pitches, and ran a “join a team” trials event. Within weeks the league was up and running with 10 teams, which was fantastic.\\nHowever, it was taking a lot of my time and so I needed to start delegating. I asked for volunteers to fill the roles of social secretary, treasurer, etc. That took some load off me and was also beneficial in that they brought in some great skills that I didn’t have.\\n(Impact)\\nThe league and everything that went with it became my most treasured university experience, despite my team finishing last. Three years later, it’s still running and a total of almost 1000 students have taken part in the games and social events.\\n(Lessons)\\nThis experience taught me that with a bit of initiative, you can make big things happen. Also, being in charge of something that involved so many people gave me a lot more confidence in other aspects of my life and work.\\xa0\\nFinally, it also taught me how important it is as a leader to know how to delegate, not only to give yourself more time, but so you can benefit from other people’s skills and perspectives.\"',\n",

He was also very shy. After the first week, he hadn’t completed many of the tasks he was given and people stopped asking for his help. Our manager was so busy that he didn’t really pay much attention to the situation.\\n(Solution)\\xa0\\nI decided to sit with Mo at lunch and ask him about his experience with coding. I gradually realized that while he’d never worked in a team like ours before, he was a talented programmer. I told him what I was working on and he seemed confident he could help.\\nI delegated some of my tasks to Mo over the next couple of days, making it clear that if he didn’t understand something, he should just ask. He completed the tasks very well. By now he came to sit with me every lunchtime and was starting to come out of his shell. I used the time he’d saved me to show him some things on GitHub and Django, and I made sure I told everyone about the great job he’d done for me.\\xa0\\n(Impact)\\nThe rest of the team started sending him tasks again and this time Mo completed the tasks much more successfully, occasionally asking me for help. Three months later, his internship ended and he joined the team full-time.\\n(Lessons)\\nThe experience with Mo made me realize that when somebody joins a team, it’s really important that they have someone to go to when they don’t understand something or have a problem.
