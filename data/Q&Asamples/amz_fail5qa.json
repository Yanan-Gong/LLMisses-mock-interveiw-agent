        "example_answer": "Example answer: personal failure\n\"A couple of years ago, I played a trumpet solo at our high school end of year performance.\nIt was a big deal for me and I practiced very thoroughly because I was very worried about making a mistake on the day. I really wanted to impress my friends and family.\nWhen the moment came, I was extremely nervous and I hit quite a few wrong notes. Afterwards I never wanted to play trumpet again.\nReflecting a few days later, I realized that although I felt like I\u2019d let my bandmates down, they didn\u2019t hold it against me. In fact, nobody really cared about my huge \u201cfailure\u201d except me.\nFrom then on I was less worried about making mistakes and I started to enjoy orchestra much more. I even volunteered for a part in the school play (which previously I\u2019d been far too nervous to do) and I really enjoyed it, even though my acting skills are debatable!\nI realized that failure isn\u2019t terrifying. Failures happen when we try things that are hard or new, and we just have to accept them as part of the learning process, as long as we tried our best to succeed. I\u2019m looking forward to failing at plenty more things.\u201d",
        "comment_on_answer": "This is a great answer for a student applying to a college or a first job because it shows a really positive attitude. They show an enthusiasm for taking on challenges and trying new things despite their limitations, and show a really mature approach to failure."

        "example_answer": "Example answer: personal failure\n(Situation)\n\u201cI love playing soccer and in my first week at college I went to the trials. I\u2019m pretty good and I was hoping to make at least the second team.\n(Problem)\nHowever, I hadn\u2019t been playing regularly and was pretty unfit. I was off the pace and didn\u2019t play anywhere near my level. I didn\u2019t make any of the teams. I was incredibly disappointed.\n(Solution)\nI vowed that I\u2019d ace the trials the next year. I played regularly in casual games and made a name for myself as a decent player.\n(Impact)\nWhen trials finally came around again, I was fit and raring to go, and I made the first team.\n(Lessons)\nThe experience taught me to never take anything for granted, being over-prepared is much better than being under-prepared. I\u2019ve also learned that life is full of disappointments, but the ones that really sting are those you could have done something about. \nNow when something is important to me, I always make sure I give it 100%, that way there are no regrets afterwards.\u201d",

        "example_answer": "Example answer: project management failure\n(Situation)\n\"A few weeks into my previous role my manager at the time gave me a small project to run. I saw it as a great opportunity for me to make an impact.\n(Problem)\nHowever, I soon started to get confused. I hadn\u2019t taken many notes in the kick-off meeting, so I wasn\u2019t sure which points my manager had already covered. Furthermore, I had people listed to help me on the project but I was too shy to ask them if they\u2019d made progress. When I eventually did, it turned out they were waiting for my instructions.\n(Solution)\nIn the end I had to go back to my manager and explain that I was way behind schedule and needed help. She delegated another team member to work on it with me and together we did a good job, but we missed the initial deadline.\n(Impact)\nIt was my chance to impress and I completely failed to take it. I was extremely disappointed with myself.\n(Lessons)\nLooking back, it was actually an incredibly valuable experience as it made me much better at my job. I started taking more notes in meetings and made an effort to get to know people on other teams so that I\u2019d feel less embarrassed next time I needed something from them. I also learned to ask more questions at the start of projects to clarify things - that was useful not just for me but for my manager as it helped her get things more defined.\u201d",
        "comment_on_answer": "Notice how they use the SPSIL framework to good effect. In the Lessons part of the answer they demonstrate that they a) know the value of good preparation and b) put their heart and soul into things they care about. These are two very desirable traits in a candidate."

        "example_answer": "Example answer: deadline failure\n(Situation)\n\u201cIn my last position, I was the product manager for a key feature of a new product we were about to launch. My team was ahead of schedule, so I told our chief product officer that we would finish a week before the deadline. She rearranged launch dates accordingly.\n(Problem)\nHowever, as we continued work on the launch, it quickly became clear that the final details would take longer than anticipated, and we would not be meeting the earlier deadline.\n(Solution)\nI took it upon myself to speed up the process. First, I added some of my team\u2019s workload to my plate in order to accomplish everything faster. I worked overtime to take care of the loose ends, then booked a new meeting with the chief product officer to explain.\u00a0\n(Impact)\nUltimately, we were able to complete our preparations just in time for the original launch date, not a full week ahead like I'd anticipated. Thankfully, since it was only the earlier deadline I failed to meet, the product was still able to be launched on the original launch date one week later.\n(Lessons)\nThe failure to meet that deadline reminded me to make decisions based on data and observation, not excitement. Since this mistake, I\u2019ve been meticulous about deadlines, only setting or changing them after I\u2019ve discussed it with the team and considered the repercussions. I haven\u2019t missed a deadline since.\u201d",
        "comment_on_answer": "Notice how the candidate doesn\u2019t try and blame their manager for not giving them a clear enough brief. Instead, they take full responsibility, but frame it as a positive learning experience by listing specific ways it helped them improve at their job."

        "example_answer": "Example answer: people management failure\n(Situation and problem)\n\u201cA few years ago, 6 months into my first ever management role, my team was frequently failing to meet its deadlines. I had enjoyed working under managers who were very hands-off, and so I had followed the same approach with my team. However, it was clear it was not working. What\u2019s more, one of the highest performers left for another company.\n(Solution)\nTo rectify the situation, I increased the number of team meetings and set regular 1-to-1 meetings with each team member. Every morning we had a quick progress check and everyone had to update the shared spreadsheet with their progress and warn of potential bottlenecks.\n(Impact)\nOur performance improved dramatically, and in H2 we hit all our main deadlines and completed 80% of our OKRs, which was above average for the company. Gradually, we were able to restore our reputation as a high performing team that could be relied on.\n(Lessons)\nI learned that it\u2019s really important to put simple processes in place that enable regular feedback, progress reports, etc. I also realized that my management style was based on instinct rather than actual expertise. To rectify that, I read three great management books and went on a very useful 3-day course. I learned some really key skills that form the basis of my approach to management today.\u201d",
        "comment_on_answer": "Over-promising to a client or being overly optimistic on a deadline\u00a0 can be good examples of failures to use in your answer as it helps you come across as hard-working and enthusiastic. Here the candidate takes full responsibility for the failure and lists lots of positive actions that they took in response."
