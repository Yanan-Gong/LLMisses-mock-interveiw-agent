We held daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and prioritize tasks. I took on the role of the Scrum Master, facilitating the meetings and making sure that everyone had a clear understanding of their responsibilities.\nOne particular challenge we faced was the need to integrate a third-party data visualization library with our custom backend solution. I took the initiative to organize a brainstorming session with the frontend and backend developers, UX designers, and data scientists.\nTogether we explored different integration approaches and identified potential roadblocks.\n(Impact)\u00a0\nWe were successful in delivering the real-time data analytics platform within the given timeline. What\u2019s more, the client was delighted with the platform\u2019s user-friendly interface, real-time insights, and advanced visualizations.\n(Lessons)\nThis experience taught me how important communication skills are in my role. As a software engineer, I had previously thought that the most important skill I had was my ability as a programmer. But this project taught me that by communicating well with other people and other teams, I could have a far greater impact than I could just through writing code.\u201d\n"

It was a small, family business with a few employees, resistant to change, and located in a neighborhood with new shops and restaurants opening constantly.\n(Problem)\u00a0\nIt was also starting to lose regular customers and revenue, but we didn\u2019t know why. The owner was trying all kinds of different promotions that weren\u2019t working.\n(Solution)\nI was only a barista and had no stake in the business, but wanted the shop to succeed. So I decided to find an easy way to understand the market and find some of the root-causes of the problem we were experiencing. My first step was to informally survey customers about their coffee habits as they paid for their order. This gave me insight into what other shops were popular and what people liked about them.\nNext, I stopped by some of the other shops on my way to work. I noticed a few common themes at these other popular shops: 1) They offered soy and almond as alternatives to dairy milk, 2) they emphasized fair trade coffee, and 3) they printed the WiFi password on receipts.\nI mentioned these themes to the owner and helped to prioritize easy, low-cost solutions. First, buying a few cartons of soy and almond milk allowed us to test if this made a difference to Sunny\u2019s customers without requiring a big investment. Second, most of the coffee that Sunny\u2019s sold was already fair trade, but this wasn\u2019t advertised; so I helped make a few signs to explain and placed them around the store. Third, we realized that printing the password on receipts was too cumbersome of a change, so instead I trained all baristas to ask customers if they wanted the WiFi password after they paid for their order.\u201d\n(Impact)\nAfter these changes, sales returned to normal within a couple months. Seeing this, the owner started more regularly surveying customers and executing competitive analysis, which has helped to make Sunny\u2019s one of the top coffee shops in the neighborhood to this day.\n(Lessons)\nThis all happened before my professional career really started, but it taught me that the most innovative solutions are not always radical or expensive. It\u2019s also a great reminder that understanding customer needs is crucial when trying to innovate in any business.\"\n"

And when I\u2019m working on a client-facing presentation I have a long error checklist I go through before sending.\nIt\u2019s still something I have to be conscious of but with a little bit of extra effort, I\u2019m able to keep on top of the details and prevent small errors from occurring.\u201d\n"

            "\nExample answer:\n(Situation)\n\u201cA month into my first management position, my team was only just hitting its targets. My manager asked me to assess my performance so far and I first outlined my own individual performance which had been strong, then explained how I had been trying to help my team.\n(Problem)\nMy manager told me that I was displaying the wrong mindset. She said I was acting as though his first responsibility was to meet my own targets, when in fact it was the other way around. She told me she\u2019d rather see my own individual results go down, if that meant the team\u2019s results improved overall, and that I needed to change my mindset from an \u201cexecution mindset\u201d to a \u201cleverage mindset\u201d. \nI was used to leading the way in terms of performance charts, etc, and initially I found it difficult\u00a0 to accept that I was going to have to stop doing measurable work for things that were less directly visible. \n(Solution)\nHowever, the more I thought about what my manager had said, the more it made sense.\nThe time I spent empowering my team would be multiplied by five (for each team member) in terms of value. This kind of leverage was worth much more to the firm than time I spent chasing my individual targets. \nI reorganized my workload to focus more on leverage and started to judge myself first and foremost on the results of my team. I also realized that the skills I\u2019d relied on as an individual contributor were no longer enough to excel in my position, and I started reading up on management theories and best practices.\n(Impact)\nA month later there was already a clear improvement in my team\u2019s performance as a whole. Over the next year, my team consistently exceeded the targets set and what\u2019s more, we had a much lower churn rate than the company average. \n(Lessons)\nI hadn\u2019t really understood the importance of good management until this experience. It opened my eyes to a new way of thinking, and I ended up enjoying management so much that I went off to study an MBA.\nThis experience also taught me how impactful great feedback can be. I made sure to give my team regular feedback, and also instigated a process where they gave me anonymous feedback at least every 6 months.\u201d\n"

By considering these factors, I was able to give myself a solid overview of the projects and their alignment with strategic objectives.\n(Impact)\u00a0\nThrough careful evaluation and applying the RICE framework, I successfully prioritized the projects based on their potential reach, impact, confidence, and effort.\u00a0\nI was able to take this to senior management and show them that, while we weren\u2019t in a position to finish all the projects ahead of time, we could finish the two that were most important in terms of the upcoming funding round.\nSenior management accepted my analysis and we were able to allocate resources effectively and meet their expectations. They were satisfied and my team escaped having to work a month of late nights which would have severely impacted morale.\n(Lessons)\u00a0\nThis experience reinforced the value of utilizing frameworks like RICE to prioritize projects under pressure. By incorporating a systematic approach, I was able to make informed decisions and it was much easier to convince other stakeholders of my arguments than it would have been if I had simply used my instincts to prioritize.\"\n"

To address this issue, I proposed a restructuring plan that involved merging the two departments and redistributing tasks among the team members.\nThis decision unfortunately meant we would have to let three people go. However, it was essential for the sustainability of the company.\u00a0\nTo mitigate the impact, I spent the next few days in individual meetings with the relevant team managers and many of their team members, including the three who were being let go. \nI was as transparent as I possibly could about the situation and the reasons for the redundancies. I took full responsibility for the decision, emphasizing that it had been an extremely difficult decision but that it should help put the company on a more solid footing and that no further redundancies were planned.\n(Impact)\nThe decision gradually yielded very positive outcomes. The merged department experienced improved collaboration and synergy, and after 6 months productivity was up 20% with a reduced wage bill.\n(Lessons)\nI learned that it\u2019s better to make tough decisions when necessary rather than delaying them. If I hadn\u2019t made the call to merge the departments, we would have carried on losing money and even more redundancies would have been necessary, or our department might have been axed completely.\u201d\n"
