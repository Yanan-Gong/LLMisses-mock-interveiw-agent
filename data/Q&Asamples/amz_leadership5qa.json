To make matters worse, our engineering manager was away on holiday and there was no other senior figure at the company with a technical background.\n(Solution)\nI was the most experienced member of our team and so felt that I should take the lead to rectify the situation, although I was a bit nervous as I\u2019d never led a team before. I got the team together and assigned specific tasks to each of my colleagues based on their expertise.\nAs we worked to introduce improvements, I checked in regularly with the company CEO and outlined the revised timeline based on the revised optimization plan.\n(Impact)\u00a0\nEveryone worked really efficiently and we successfully resolved the scalability issues within the project timeline. The migration was completed seamlessly, and the system performance improved significantly.\n(Lessons)\nThis project gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to lead people and projects. I also realized important soft skills are - I love coding but on this project, I found that communication and organizational skills were much more important. I\u2019ve since made an effort to develop these skills instead of just focusing on my technical abilities.\u201d",

        "example_answer": "Example answer:\n(Situation)\n\"I spent three years working at a small start up, and after an initial period of rapid growth, revenue dropped off and we started losing money.\n(Problem)\nI was leading a team of five, and understandably people were extremely worried about their jobs. I also had pressure from the CEO to implement cost-cutting and revenue-generating measures that would help us get back to break-even as soon as possible.\n(Solution)\nMy primary focus was on keeping the team motivated and productive, even in the face of uncertainty. My first action was to schedule a meeting to specifically discuss the situation and provide an honest and transparent overview of what was happening.\nI acknowledged the challenges that the company was facing, but that our team was essential to the company's success. I said that if they had any questions they could always ask me. We also came up with a list of team actions we could take that would reduce costs, and over the next 6 months I arranged bi-weekly updates with the CEO to show how we were progressing.\u00a0\n(Impact)\nThrough these actions my team played a major part in getting the company back on track, and I made sure this was visible to the CEO. There were no lay-offs in our area and morale and productivity stayed strong.\n(Lessons)\nIt was a difficult experience to go through but I learned that when you\u2019re managing a team, constant communication is vital in a crisis. People always have doubts and hypothetical scenarios you hadn't even thought of, and it\u2019s really useful to provide a space where you can listen to them, show empathy and give them a more accurate picture of what\u2019s going on, even if that picture is incomplete.\u201d",
        "comment_on_answer": "The candidate demonstrates key leadership skills such as empathy, honesty, respect, ownership and calmness under pressure. They demonstrate that they are a leader who takes steps to look after their team and are present and available in a crisis."

        "example_answer": "Example answer:\n(Situation)\n\u201cIn my last position, I was on a team of analysts working on a live deal to try to bring on a new client. We hadn\u2019t worked with them before, and it was a big name, so this was a huge opportunity for the company.\n(Problem)\nOne day before a key meeting with the potential client, the associate taking the lead on the deal got sick. As her symptoms developed, it became clear that she would not be able to attend the meeting and pitch our services to the new client. We had to decide whether to try to reschedule the meeting, or to go ahead without her leadership.\n(Solution)\nI knew that rescheduling the meeting at the last minute would make us appear unreliable to the potential client, so I called the other analysts and persuaded them that we should maintain the meeting and that I could give the pitch. They agreed, and we rehearsed the pitch together that evening.\nThe next day, I gave the pitch and was able to answer the potential client\u2019s questions, with help from the other analysts. I was able to remember most of what we prepared with the associate, and my teammates were able to support me in the other areas.\n(Impact)\nThe client asked for extra time to consider the deal, but did ultimately come back to us and accept. They are now one of our regular clients, and through that relationship alone we\u2019ve brought in a little over $200,000 in revenue for the company.\n(Lessons)\nSo I learned how important it is to prepare in advance for all eventualities. Had we set up a contingency plan prior to the pitch, the associate\u2019s illness would not have created such last-minute stress leading up to the meeting. So now I work to stay aware of needs outside of my job description, and to anticipate risks ahead of time.\u201d",
        "comment_on_answer": "Here the candidate uses an example where they stepped up to be a leader. The answer demonstrates a great deal of ownership and initiative. It also suggests the candidate has good persuasion skills, which an interviewer might want to follow up on."

        "example_answer": "Example answer:\n(Situation and problem)\nI\u2019m a keen basketball player but at the university I went to in the UK, there were no basketball teams. So I decided to take the initiative and start a basketball league on campus.\u00a0\n(Problem)\nMy goal was to get at least 6 teams and have regular, competitive games each week, plus social events so people could make new friends and feel part of a community.\n(Solution)\u00a0\nAt first I did everything myself - spread the word around campus to get sign ups, got payments and booked the pitches, and ran a \u201cjoin a team\u201d trials event. Within weeks the league was up and running with 10 teams, which was fantastic.\nHowever, it was taking a lot of my time and so I needed to start delegating. I asked for volunteers to fill the roles of social secretary, treasurer, etc. That took some load off me and was also beneficial in that they brought in some great skills that I didn\u2019t have.\n(Impact)\nThe league and everything that went with it became my most treasured university experience, despite my team finishing last. Three years later, it\u2019s still running and a total of almost 1000 students have taken part in the games and social events.\n(Lessons)\nThis experience taught me that with a bit of initiative, you can make big things happen. Also, being in charge of something that involved so many people gave me a lot more confidence in other aspects of my life and work.\u00a0\nFinally, it also taught me how important it is as a leader to know how to delegate, not only to give yourself more time, but so you can benefit from other people\u2019s skills and perspectives.\"",
        "comment_on_answer": "This is a great leadership example from someone without much professional work experience. Their example shows a lot of initiative and drive, as well as organizational skills and the ability to delegate."

        "example_answer": "Example answer:\n(Situation)\nRecently in my current role as an intern, Mo, joined our team. I had a very high workload at the time and so was grateful to see an extra pair of hands join the team.\u00a0\n(Problem)\nHowever, Mo lacked experience in some of the key tools we used daily, such as GitHub and Django. He was also very shy. After the first week, he hadn\u2019t completed many of the tasks he was given and people stopped asking for his help. Our manager was so busy that he didn\u2019t really pay much attention to the situation.\n(Solution)\u00a0\nI decided to sit with Mo at lunch and ask him about his experience with coding. I gradually realized that while he\u2019d never worked in a team like ours before, he was a talented programmer. I told him what I was working on and he seemed confident he could help.\nI delegated some of my tasks to Mo over the next couple of days, making it clear that if he didn\u2019t understand something, he should just ask. He completed the tasks very well. By now he came to sit with me every lunchtime and was starting to come out of his shell. I used the time he\u2019d saved me to show him some things on GitHub and Django, and I made sure I told everyone about the great job he\u2019d done for me.\u00a0\n(Impact)\nThe rest of the team started sending him tasks again and this time Mo completed the tasks much more successfully, occasionally asking me for help. Three months later, his internship ended and he joined the team full-time.\n(Lessons)\nThe experience with Mo made me realize that when somebody joins a team, it\u2019s really important that they have someone to go to when they don\u2019t understand something or have a problem. It also taught me how crucial it is to take the time to ask and listen, instead of dismissing people after a bad first impression.\u201d",
        "comment_on_answer": "This candidate demonstrates various leadership skills with this example: in particular a lot of initiative and empathy. The interviewer could easily imagine this candidate as a future manager who will do a great job helping his team members reach their potential."
